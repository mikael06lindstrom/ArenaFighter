# Arena Fighter Application AS .Net Core Console Application

## Assignment

Your assignment is to make a simple game, based on dice rolls. 
In this game, the player creates a character, and proceeds to 
fight randomly generated opponents until the player character loses,
in which case the game should end. 
At every victory, the player should be offered the chance to retire his character, which should also end the game. 
Once battle starts, roll a dice by generating a random number between 1 and 6, and adding it to the strength value of the character. 
Then compare the total strength values of both characters and have the character with the highest value deal damage to the other.
